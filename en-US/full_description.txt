Plays sound every hour (hourly chime) and much more!

It can be used as a cuckoo clock or mindfulness bell - every time it rings it gives you chance to think what time is it or what you are currently doing.

By default it plays short sound every hour regardless of day or time of day. It can not only beep hourly but also on shorter periods like 30 or 15 minutes. The time signal can be configured for example to limit chime time to specific hours or days, see below for full list of options.

List of features:
- play sound in regular intervals (e.g. every hour)
- several sounds to choose (e.g. Casio watch beep, gong, ship's bell, cuckoo)
- enable vibration during playing sound (choose from several vibrations)
- quiet hours (e.g. from 22:00 to 6:00)
- quiet days (e.g. Saturday and Sunday)
- display when upcoming notification will occur
- light up screen when playing sound
- choose audio stream (ring, alarm, media, notification) - choose ring for sound to follow phone ringtone (choose this if you don't want sound in silent mode)
- lower notification sound volume compared to chosen audio stream (using slider)
- change audio stream sound volume using hardware volume keys in the app
- continue working after reboot or app update
- option to disable while music is playing on device
- disable notification during phone call
- no ads

Battery optimization modes or apps warning.
Please note that if the app stops working unexpectedly it may be caused by some phone function or app which stops apps to increase battery life (power saving, battery optimization, eco, task killers, etc.). In such case, please disable it for BlipBlip for the app to function correctly.

Note to Samsung users:
On some devices Alarm mode will be enabled in Advanced Settings to fix issue with notifications being late by several minutes. It should be enabled after first delayed notification on version 1.0.9 or newer of the app.
Instead of Alarm mode you can also try to use "Light up screen on notification".

If you have any problem please contact us by using "Report problem" from the app, describe your problem and send  it (I will receive logs from the app).
