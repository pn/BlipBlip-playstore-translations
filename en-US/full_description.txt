Simple time reminder, plays sounds regularly (hourly chime), but can do much more!.

It can be used as a cuckoo clock or mindfulness bell - every time it rings it gives you chance to think what time it is or what you are currently doing.

By default it plays short sound every hour regardless of day or time of day. It can not only beep hourly but also on shorter periods like 30 or 15 minutes. The time signal can be configured for example to limit chime time to specific hours or days, see below for full list of options.

You can use it also as reminder (e.g. to drink more water or take break from computer screen) by customizing text in the notification.
