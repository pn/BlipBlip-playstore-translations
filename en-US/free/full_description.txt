Simple reminder of passing time. Plays sounds regularly (e.g. every hour) but can do much more!

This free version has all premium features and sounds unlocked in exchange for watching ads. Ads can be removed by purchasing subscription.

App can be used as a cuckoo clock or mindfulness bell - every time it rings it gives you chance to think what time it is or what you are currently doing.

By default it plays short sound every half hour regardless of day or time of day. It can not only beep hourly but also on any period specified. The time signal can be configured to limit chime time to specific hours or days, see below for full list of options.

You can use it also as reminder by customizing text in the notification (e.g. remind to drink more water or take break from computer screen).

*** IMPORTANT: To allow the app to fuction correctly please disable power saving settings. ***
